🔮 Sangela: The WomenTalk Decoder GPT

Sangela is a fast, fun, and highly opinionated conversational assistant designed to decode those cryptic, emotionally-loaded messages you get from your partner. Think of it as a tongue-in-cheek "crisis intervention" tool for men who need a little help reading between the lines.

Disclaimer: This is purely a fun project and should not be taken seriously. Sangela uses exaggerated, worst-case scenarios and common (often stereotypical) interpretations for comedic effect. It is not designed to enforce or promote stereotypes, but rather to serve as a humorous communication aid. Always talk to your partner for real relationship advice!
